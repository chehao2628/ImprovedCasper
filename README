This project implemented a improved Casper learning algorithm introduced in submitted paper "Empirical Evaluation of Improved Casper Learning Algorithm on Emotion Recognition".

Please:
Run FullyConnectedNetwork.py to measure Fully connected neural network with K fold validation on SFEW Dataset.
Run KfoldMain.py to measure improved Casper with K fold validation on SFEW Dataset.

Note: Run KfoldMain.py is high time cost. Run SimpleMain.py can test without cross validation.

Techniques mentioned in submitted paper are implemented as following:

Add Noise: in Class DataFrameDataset() of python file Dataloader.py
Z-score transformation: in Function normalization() of python file Dataloader.py
Weighted Sampler: in Function make_weights_for_balanced_classes of python file Dataloader.py
Techniques in Casper Model Training include Leakey ReLU, Cross Entropy Error function, RMSprop and Epoch limitation
release are integrated in KfoldMain.py, KfoldMain.py and FullyConnectedNetwork.py.
